# Stock Price Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing historical stock price data to identify trends, outliers, and patterns, as well as to forecast future stock prices. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, outlier detection, trend analysis, and time series forecasting. The insights gained from this analysis can help in making informed investment decisions.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the overall trends and patterns in the stock price data.
- Identify and handle outliers in the data.
- Analyze seasonality and long-term trends.
- Forecast future stock prices using time series models.
- Evaluate stock volatility and perform risk-return analysis.
- Assess the impact of external factors on stock prices.
- Develop data-driven investment strategies based on the analysis.

## Data Description
The dataset contains monthly stock price data with the following columns:
- `Date`: The date of the observation.
- `Open`: The opening price of the stock.
- `High`: The highest price of the stock during the month.
- `Low`: The lowest price of the stock during the month.
- `Close`: The closing price of the stock.

## Project Structure

## Key Analyses
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand overall trends and patterns.
   - Visualize data using line charts, histograms, and box plots.

2. **Outlier Detection**
   - Identify outliers using the IQR method or other statistical techniques.
   - Handle outliers appropriately (e.g., removal or transformation).

3. **Trend and Seasonality Analysis**
   - Decompose time series data to analyze seasonal patterns and trends.
   - Use moving averages or exponential smoothing.

4. **Time Series Forecasting**
   - Implement ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM models to forecast future stock prices.
   - Evaluate model performance using MAE or RMSE.

5. **Volatility Analysis**
   - Calculate and analyze stock volatility over different periods.
   - Use standard deviation or GARCH models.

6. **Risk and Return Analysis**
   - Perform risk-return analysis using metrics like the Sharpe Ratio.

7. **Impact of External Factors**
   - Investigate the impact of economic indicators and geopolitical events on stock prices.
   - Use regression analysis or causal inference methods.
